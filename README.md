This is an implementation of the paper "Tensor network factorizations:  Relationships between brain structural connectomes and traits". Some real data from the Human Connectome Project is also provided. 

To run the code, unzip the "tensor_toolbox.zip", and run either "realdata_HCP.m" or "simulation_hopca_popNet.m" using MATLAB.
